## Intorduction
This being my first post here, a little introduction seems fitting. This is the first post in the upcoming series of posts, updating my progress on the project: Wio Terminal as Zephyr Greybus host. This project is part of my work under the [Beagleboard](https://beagleboard.org/) organization.

## Getting to know Greybus and Zephyr
Since this is my first time working with either of the technologies, I am starting off by experimenting with both.

### Blinky on BeagleConnect Freedom

BeagleConnect Freedom runs a CC1352 MCU and can run Zephyr RTOS on it. First I set up the Zephyr SDK, following the [official Zephyr guide](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/getting_started/index.html). `west` is Zephyr's meta-tool and is a Python package. Whenever you are working with Python, I heavily recommend using virtual environments, to not clutter up your global Python environment.
