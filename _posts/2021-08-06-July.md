## Introduction
This being my first post here, a little introduction seems fitting. This is the first post in the upcoming series of posts, updating my progress on the project: Wio Terminal as Zephyr Greybus host. This project is part of my work under the [Beagleboard](https://beagleboard.org/) organization.


## Getting to know Greybus and Zephyr
Since this is my first time working with either of the technologies, I started off by experimenting with both and reading Zephyr's getting started guides, which I highly recommend to anyone new to Zephyr development:
* [Getting started guide](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/getting_started/index.html)
* [Beyond the getting started guide](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/guides/beyond-GSG.html#beyond-gsg)
* [Zephyr application development](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/application/index.html#application)
On top of that, I recommend to read up on [DeviceTree](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/reference/devicetree/index.html#devicetree) as it is used for Zephyr development and it's useful to understand it.

Here is a summary of what I did so far:
* Setting up Zephyr environment
* Flashing blinky on BeagleConnect Freedom + Sensortest sample
* Making some changes to the sample programs to get a feel of Zephyr development
* Building+Flashing [Greybus net demo for GPIO and I2C](https://github.com/jadonk/beagleconnect#24ghz-ieee-802154-greybus-demo-for-gpio-and-i2c)

Plus elements in progress for this milestone:
* Setting up VM with patched Linux Kernel for testing the target device

### Blinky on BeagleConnect Freedom

BeagleConnect Freedom runs a CC1352 MCU and can run Zephyr RTOS on it. First I set up the Zephyr SDK, following the [official Zephyr guide](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/getting_started/index.html). `west` is Zephyr's meta-tool and is a Python package. Whenever you are working with Python, I heavily recommend using virtual environments, to not clutter up your global Python environment.

After some time spent on fiddling with `west` and Zephyr, I have figured out how to properly flash programs on the BeagleConnect Freedom. In order to flash the CC1352 MCU onboard BCF, first MSP430 (which is also on the BCF) needs to be flashed with temporary firmware for flashing CC1352. Afterwards, BeagleConnect Freedom can be flashed with `west`.
As I didn't want to do this by hand each time, I took a look into the existing building/flashing scripts on the [beagleconnect repo](https://github.com/jadonk/beagleconnect/tree/master/sw) and now I use a modifed version of them. With that I flashed a simple blinky program and another sensortest demo which should give the readings of onboard sensors. However, the sensortest demo seems to not work as I expected it to, failing to read the sensor data, so I left it for now.

## 2.4GHz IEEE 802.15.4 Greybus demo for GPIO and I2C
After getting some feel for Zephyr, time came to try it with Greybus. I decided that a good starting point would be to try out one of the demo's available on the beagleconnect repo, in particular [2.4GHz IEEE 802.15.4 Greybus demo for GPIO and I2C](https://github.com/jadonk/beagleconnect#24ghz-ieee-802154-greybus-demo-for-gpio-and-i2c). The demo uses a [CC1352R1 Launchpad](https://www.ti.com/tool/LAUNCHXL-CC1352R1), but it should work just fine with the up-to-date BeagleConnect Freedom board running a CC1352.

### Prereading
I have read some articles on it to get a better grasp of it. In particular [Chris Friedt's Post Plumbers Publication gist](https://gist.github.com/cfriedt/1de7ba75c04d0e403cbdcb9555d0c795) shone some light on the topic along with the sources listed by him.

### Flashing the BeagleConnect Freedom
Thanks to my previous fiddling with Zephyr and flashing the BCF, I knew more or less what to do here. In short, I built the [`greybus net` demo program](https://github.com/jadonk/greybus-for-zephyr/tree/a08b3c297e5ac597b93956a76aa2e64043b65f8e/samples/subsys/greybus/net) and flashed it using `west`. Then it was a matter of checking if it flashed correctly by connecting to it via `tio` terminal (`tio /dev/ttyACM0`) and checking whether Zephyr's output is correct.

### Setting up the Linux host
After flashing the target device and ensuring everything is in working order, I set up my Linux host device to try and connect to the BeagleConnect Freedom wirelessly. This required a 5.8.4 Linux Kernel with MikroBus patches (along with a few others). 
As I didn't want to experiment with a custom Kernel on my host device, I set up a [Virtualbox VM](https://www.virtualbox.org/) with Ubuntu, where I cloned the Kernel and on a new branch built it with the patches applied. There were some problems while building, in particular in the `mikrobus linux kernel driver`: 
```ld: drivers/misc/mikrobus/mikrobus_core.o: in function `mikrobus_board_register.cold':
mikrobus_core.c:(.text.unlikely+0x456): undefined reference to `clk_register_fixed_rate'
make: *** [Makefile:1139: vmlinux] Error 1```

I looked into that driver's sourcecode, and someone left a comment they are working on it, so I just commented out the line in question and it built fine. (Hopefully I will not regret it later).

I then installed all modules using `sudo make modules_install` and installed the kernel itself with `sudo make install`. On reboot the newly installed kernel failed to initialise with the below error:
```

```

According to [an old question on askubuntu](https://askubuntu.com/questions/41930/kernel-panic-not-syncing-vfs-unable-to-mount-root-fs-on-unknown-block0-0), this is due to missing initramfs for the patched Kernel, so I generated `intrid` for that kernel `version` using `sudo update-initramfs -u -k version` (`version` in my case was `5.8.4-00895-g797f3a30dd4f-dirty`).
Then I updated the GRUB menu using `sudo update-grub` (and because I am running GRUB version >2, I ran `sudo update-grub2`). 
Unfortunately this still resulted in the same error and after spending some more time on it without any success I left it as is to push the project forward from a different angle.

**I will get back to this milestone once I hear back from the Beagleboard community/get an idea as to what may be wrong** Things I can still try to get it to work:
* Try patching the kernel on my host machine (may be a VM-specific bug)
* Try the patched kernel on a different distro, e.g. Arch (may be a distro-specifc bug)
* Try and patch the [Ubuntu Kernel](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/BuildYourOwnKernel) with the mikrobus and greybus patches


### Pinging Zephyr

In order to ping the BeagleConnect, first a different device (e.g. a BeagleConnect) needs to be flashed with a usb_uart_bridge [software](https://github.com/jadonk/msp430F55xx_usb_uart_bridge) to be able to communicate over IEEE 802.15.4

Follow the guide linked above.

Then using [`wpanusb` linux kernel driver](https://github.com/jadonk/wpanusb#configuring-6lowpan-address) you can ping it (first run modprobe.sh to find the usb_uart_bridge device, then `sudo scripts/lowpan.sh 2 5 && ip -6 monitor dev lowpan0` to assign an ipv6 address. It should now be visible when calling `ip addr show dev lowpan0` or `ip a show lowpan0`. **Last but very important step:** Make sure both devices are on the same channel, you can check which channel the BeagleConnect is on by calling `ieee802154 get_chan`, and then on the Linux machine run `iwpan list` to get phy number of the `lowpan0` device, and set the channel for the 802.15.4 device: `sudo iwpan phy {PHY NUMBER} set channel 0 {CHANNELNO}`
