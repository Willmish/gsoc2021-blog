## Intorduction
This being my first post here, a little introduction seems fitting. This is the first post in the upcoming series of posts, updating my progress on the project: Wio Terminal as Zephyr Greybus host. This project is part of my work under the [Beagleboard](https://beagleboard.org/) organization.


## Getting to know Greybus and Zephyr
Since this is my first time working with either of the technologies, I started off by experimenting with both and reading Zephyr's getting started guides, which I highly recommend to anyone new to Zephyr development:
* [Getting started guide](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/getting_started/index.html)
* [Beyond the getting started guide](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/guides/beyond-GSG.html#beyond-gsg)
* [Zephyr application development](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/application/index.html#application)
On top of that, I recommend to read up on [DeviceTree](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/reference/devicetree/index.html#devicetree) as it is used for Zephyr development and it's useful to understand it.

Here is a summary of what I did so far:
* Setting up Zephyr environment
* Flashing blinky on BeagleConnect Freedom + Sensortest sample
* Making some changes to the sample programs to get a feel of Zephyr development
* Building+Flashing [Greybus net demo for GPIO and I2C](https://github.com/jadonk/beagleconnect#24ghz-ieee-802154-greybus-demo-for-gpio-and-i2c)
* Setting up VM with patched Linux Kernel for testing the target device

### Blinky on BeagleConnect Freedom

BeagleConnect Freedom runs a CC1352 MCU and can run Zephyr RTOS on it. First I set up the Zephyr SDK, following the [official Zephyr guide](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/getting_started/index.html). `west` is Zephyr's meta-tool and is a Python package. Whenever you are working with Python, I heavily recommend using virtual environments, to not clutter up your global Python environment.

After some time spent on fiddling with `west` and Zephyr, I have figured out how to properly flash programs on the BeagleConnect Freedom. In order to flash the CC1352 MCU onboard BCF, first MSP430 (which is also on the BCF) needs to be flashed with temporary firmware for flashing CC1352. Afterwards, BeagleConnect Freedom can be flashed with `west`.
As I didn't want to do this by hand each time, I took a look into the existing building/flashing scripts on the [beagleconnect repo](https://github.com/jadonk/beagleconnect/tree/master/sw) and now I use a modifed version of them. With that I flashed a simple blinky program and another sensortest demo which should give the readings of onboard sensors. However, the sensortest demo seems to not work as I expected it to, failing to read the sensor data, so I left it for now.

## 2.4GHz IEEE 802.15.4 Greybus demo for GPIO and I2C
After getting some feel for Zephyr, time came to try it with Greybus.

### Prereading
I have read some articles on it to get a better grasp of it. In particular [Chris Friedt's Post Plumbers Publication gist](https://gist.github.com/cfriedt/1de7ba75c04d0e403cbdcb9555d0c795) shone some light on the topic along with the sources listed by him.
