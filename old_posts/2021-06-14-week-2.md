## Setting up PowerVR SDK tutorial
The step-by-step instruction on how to setup the SDK is available [here](https://jduchniewicz.github.io/gsoc2021-blog/posts/2021/06/15/installing-powervr-sdk.html)

## Coding
Initially, I wanted to develop everything [in one place](https://github.com/JDuchniewicz/GPGPU-with-GLES), but because the SDK has so many dependencies moving it out proved to be challenging.

Because of that I will code the SDK related part (testing algorithm soundness on emulator) - _under_ the SDK and move it out only after I have significant progress in project. Otherwise I would get bogged down by the task and it would steal precious time.

It seems like I need to set up EGL to run headless (without a GUI) and this requires some hacks on my side, like [in this repository](https://gist.github.com/dcommander/ee1247362201552b2532).

I started fleshing out the library code, but it is mostly API forming time and not the actual implementation. For this I need to discuss it more with Hunyue and Iain as I have several doubts about the actual implementation.

I am also developing the library testing code under `lib/examples` for easy testing on the target. As the project progreses I want to show different usages of the API an different solutions in each example. They all build in tree of our project.

I succesfully wrote the modern CMake files, for finding GLES2 and configuring my library as an _imported target_ for future integrators. I based on [Pablo's blog](https://pabloariasal.github.io/2018/02/19/its-time-to-do-cmake-right/) and of course Stackoverflow, as CMake is never _THAT_ easy.

I also tried getting the headless EGL to work, but was met with some blockers on the latest recommended BB image, so I changed the image to one with PowerVR SDK preinstalled and configured, so that EGL works out of the box.
